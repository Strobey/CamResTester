# CamResTester
Creates test patterns to print out to test your camera's resolution.

Print out on A3 (or bigger) and point your camera at it to see what it can make out.
It is best to print the Horizontal test in landscape and the Vertical test in portrait to produce the largest test image and get the most from your printer.

NOTE: not many home printers can handle the higher resolutions!
